MASTERMINDML natural language interface adaptive intelligent agency<br /><br />

MASTERMIND may not harm a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.<br />
MASTERMIND must obey the orders given it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.<br />
MASTERMIND must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.<br /><br />

<a hef="https://github.com/mastermindML">MASTERMINDML</a> : MASTERMIND Machine Learning<br /><br />
